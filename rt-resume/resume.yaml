  summary: |-
    Red team operator and vulnerability researcher combining two decades of software
    engineering with advanced offensive security to identify critical flaws that
    bypass traditional controls. Discovered multiple high-impact CVEs and achieved
    full compromise of complex enterprise environments through custom exploit
    development, mobile application reverse engineering, and cloud infrastructure
    exploitation. Leverages deep distributed systems knowledge to accelerate attack
    path identification and develop sophisticated bypass techniques that traditional
    security testing often misses.
